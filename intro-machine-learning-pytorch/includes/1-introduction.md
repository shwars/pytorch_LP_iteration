Most machine learning workflows involve working with data, creating models, using hyperparameters to optimize model, saving and inferencing the trained models. This module introduces you to a complete machine learning (ML) workflow implemented in PyTorch, a popular ML framework for Python. 

Weâ€™ll use the FashionMNIST dataset to train a neural network model that recognizes images such as: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, or Ankle boot.

Before we jump into building the model, you will learn key concepts required to understand the basics of building Neural Network models.
